# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## Overview of Project
Belly button bacteria is being researched by various entities to determine abundancy and feasible uses. To assist the research a group of volunteers provided belly button bacteria samples and demographic information.  A webpage is needed to enable users to pull and analyze the data set that includes bacteria and demographic attributes.  

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to build a webpage dashboard that includes a filter on Test Subject ID No. To filter a specific test subject the user clicks a dropdown selection box under Test Subject ID No. and selects the ID. For each filtered test subject the page will show demographic info, top 10 bacteria cultures found shown in a bar chart, belly button washing frequency shown in a gauge chart and bacteria cultures per sample shown in a bubble chart.

## Results
The webpage and filter capability as shown below was successfully constructed using HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript and JSON.  The data set resides in a JSON Source File.

## Summary
The webpage and filter capability gives users the ability to view the volunteer sample set more efficiently for research and analysis purposes.  In the future this webpage can be further developed and enhanced with additional, useful charts that slice and dice the data as well as if there are additional samples and/or sample types provided for research purposes.
